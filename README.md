# Algorithms and Data Structures Implementations

This repository contains implementations of exercises from the Algorithms and Data Structures (ASD) course at Parthenope University of Naples. The implementations are written in C++ and serve as examples for various topics covered in the course, including Binary Search Trees (ABR), Graphs, Queues, Heaps, Templates, Linked Lists, Vectors, Dynamic Programming, Sorting Algorithms, and more. Please note that all code is developed for academic purposes only.

## Contents

The repository includes the following implementations:

- ABR (Binary Search Trees): Implementation of binary search trees, including insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- Graphs: Implementation of graph data structure and commonly used graph algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).
- Queues: Implementation of queue data structure using arrays and linked lists.
- Heaps: Implementation of heap data structure, including heapify, insertion, and extraction operations.
- Templates: Examples of using templates in C++ for generic programming.
- Linked Lists: Implementation of linked list data structure, including basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Vectors: Implementation of vector data structure similar to the standard template library (STL) vector in C++.
- Dynamic Programming: Implementations of dynamic programming algorithms for solving various problems.
- Sorting Algorithms: Implementation of commonly used sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

## Getting Started

To use the implementations in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the desired implementation directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable file generated after compilation.
5. Follow the provided instructions or modify the code for your specific needs.

Feel free to explore the implementations, modify them, and use them as a reference for your own projects or further study of algorithms and data structures in C++.
